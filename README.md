# FCFS-Simulator
This programming project is to simulate a few CPU scheduling policies
discussed in the class. You will write a C/C++ program to implement a
simulator with different scheduling algorithms. The simulator selects a task to
run from ready queue based on the scheduling algorithm. Since the project
intends to simulate a CPU scheduler, so it does not require any actual process
creation or execution. When a task is scheduled, the simulator will simply print
out what task is selected to run at a time. It outputs the way similar to Gantt
chart style. 2. Project Descriptions: The selected scheduling algorithm to
implement in this project is First Come.
